# Wordle built with C++ & Qt

A simple Wordle game I wrote when I was attending the OOP course during the summer semester.

The game can be compiled in Linux with a Qt environment. Windows release is available, and you can easily find them in the `release` section. Alternatively, you can download the portable version if you prefer.
